Follow the following steps :

1. Put all .csv files in "Data/" folder --- very very important

2. Delete "Frequency.csv"

3. Run "QueryExpansion.py"

4. Time is in some other units, and I don't think it matters what unit the time is in.

5. Run "ReRank.py"

6. You see 7 ranks printed, if you want to change this value, change "x" in line 6 of ReRank.py. But if I were you, I wouldn't change any values in the program, it causes trouble.

7. Any other doubts, contact : No-one, no one can solve your doubts !
